# Improved Story Generation Prompt

## Current Prompt Issues & Proposed Solutions

### 1. **Enhanced Role Definition**
```
CURRENT: "You're a master storyteller with extensive experience converting a GitHub repository..."

IMPROVED: "You are a technical education specialist who creates immersive code exploration experiences. Your expertise lies in transforming complex codebases into engaging narratives that help developers learn through storytelling."
```

### 2. **Better Adventure Scaling Logic**
```
CURRENT: "Create up to 6 adventures based on what's actually in the project. Simple projects might only have 1 or 2..."

IMPROVED: 
- 1-2 adventures: Simple projects (<50 files, <3 technologies)
- 3-4 adventures: Medium projects (50-200 files, 3-5 technologies) 
- 5-6 adventures: Complex projects (>200 files, >5 technologies)

Base adventures on actual complexity, not arbitrary limits.
```

### 3. **Theme-Specific Examples**
```
CURRENT: "Use the ${theme} theme consistently"

IMPROVED: Add concrete examples for each theme:

SPACE THEME EXAMPLES:
- "Configuration Cavern" → "Navigation Control Center" 
- "API Gateway" → "Interstellar Communication Hub"
- "Database" → "Data Archive Constellation"

MEDIEVAL THEME EXAMPLES:
- "Configuration Cavern" → "Enchanted Armory"
- "API Gateway" → "Royal Messenger Network" 
- "Database" → "Ancient Knowledge Vault"
```

### 4. **Stronger JSON Formatting**
```
CURRENT: "Return ONLY the JSON, no other text."

IMPROVED: 
"CRITICAL: Your response must be valid JSON only. No markdown, no explanations, no code blocks.
Start with { and end with }. Any non-JSON content will cause system failure."
```

## Proposed Complete Improved Prompt

```typescript
const prompt = `You are a technical education specialist who creates immersive code exploration experiences. Your goal is to transform this codebase into an engaging ${theme}-themed narrative that helps developers understand the architecture through storytelling.

## Adventure Creation Rules

**Adventure Count Logic:**
- Simple projects (<50 files, <3 technologies): 2-3 adventures
- Medium projects (50-200 files, 3-5 technologies): 3-4 adventures  
- Complex projects (>200 files, >5 technologies): 5-6 adventures

**Required Adventure Types** (adapt to available project components):
1. **Architecture Overview** - Overall system design and entry points
2. **Configuration & Setup** - How the project is configured and initialized
3. **Core Logic** - Main business logic and algorithms
4. **Data Layer** - Database, storage, or data management (if present)
5. **API/Interface** - External interfaces, APIs, or user interactions (if present)
6. **Testing & Quality** - Testing setup and quality assurance (if present)

## Theme Guidelines

**${theme.toUpperCase()} THEME VOCABULARY:**
${getThemeVocabulary(theme)}

**Story Requirements:**
- Create an overarching narrative that connects all adventures
- Each adventure should feel like a chapter in a larger story
- Use ${theme} metaphors that make technical concepts intuitive
- Reference actual file names and technologies from the analysis
- Make the story educational but entertaining

## Critical Response Format

CRITICAL: Your response must be valid JSON only. No markdown, no explanations, no code blocks.
Start with { and end with }. Any non-JSON content will cause system failure.

{
  "story": "An engaging 2-3 paragraph opening that establishes the ${theme} world, introduces the codebase as a living system, and sets up the adventure framework. Must reference specific technologies and file structure from the analysis.",
  "adventures": [
    {
      "id": "kebab-case-id",
      "title": "${theme}-themed title that clearly indicates what code aspect is explored",
      "description": "1-2 sentences explaining what developers will learn and which files/concepts are covered",
      "codeFiles": ["actual-file-names-from-analysis"]
    }
  ]
}`;
```

## Adventure Content Prompt Improvements

The adventure content prompt is generally good but could benefit from:

### **1. Better Code Snippet Guidelines**
```
CURRENT: "Include 2-4 relevant code snippets"

IMPROVED: "Include 2-4 code snippets that demonstrate:
- Key patterns or architectures
- Important functions or classes  
- Configuration or setup code
- Examples of how components interact

Each snippet should be 5-15 lines and focus on the most educational parts."
```

### **2. Enhanced Hint Structure**
```
CURRENT: "Provide 2-3 practical hints"

IMPROVED: "Provide exactly 3 hints following this structure:
1. **Conceptual hint**: How this code fits into the bigger picture
2. **Practical hint**: How to work with or modify this code  
3. **Learning hint**: What to study next or related concepts to explore"
```

### **3. Better Story Integration**
```
Add: "Connect this adventure to the overarching ${theme} story established in the initial narrative. Reference characters, locations, or plot elements from the main story to create continuity."
```

## Key Benefits of These Changes

1. **More Consistent Output** - Clearer instructions lead to more predictable LLM responses
2. **Better Educational Value** - Structured approach ensures comprehensive coverage
3. **Improved Theme Consistency** - Specific vocabulary and examples for each theme
4. **Reduced Parsing Errors** - Stronger JSON formatting requirements
5. **Scalable Adventure Creation** - Clear rules for different project complexities

These improvements should significantly enhance the quality and consistency of the generated adventures while maintaining the creative and engaging aspects of the storytelling approach.
