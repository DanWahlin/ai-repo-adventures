# Story-Based Quest Generator for GitHub Repos

## üéØ OBJECTIVE

Turn the provided codebase into an immersive, theme-driven story that helps developers understand what the code does through narrative. Then, break that story into **interconnected quests** (typically 3-7 based on codebase size and complexity) that each contribute to the main storyline while exploring specific technical components or files from the codebase.

**CRITICAL: These quests are parts of a single overarching story, NOT standalone tasks. Users can explore them in any order.**

Each quest should:

- **Contribute to the main narrative** while being explorable independently
- **Connect to the overall story goal** from different angles  
- Reference only real files and concepts from the codebase
- Guide the developer deeper into understanding the repo through thematic exploration
- Use a fun, creative theme (e.g., space, mythical, ancient, cyberpunk)
- **Be self-contained yet part of the larger adventure**

## üîß FINAL VALIDATION RULES (DO NOT SKIP)

‚úÖ File Name Integrity:

- ONLY use file paths shown in the "## Project Codebase" section (marked by "## File:")
- DO NOT invent or describe any file that isn‚Äôt listed
- PREFER: Main application files over utility/config/type files
- Better to leave \`codeFiles: []\` than include an incorrect filename

‚úÖ Quest Structure:

- **Each quest contributes to the overarching story** while being explorable independently
- Each description is exactly **1 sentence** that describes the quest's exploration area and technical focus
- Use second-person POV ("You venture into...", "You explore...", "You discover...")
- **NO standalone tasks** ‚Äî every quest connects to the main story theme and goal
- **Quests should be self-contained** but part of the larger narrative universe

## üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è STORY CREATION INSTRUCTIONS

1. **ANALYZE** the \`## Project Codebase\` section to understand the project codebase and its purpose  
2. Create a \`{{theme}}\`-themed narrative that uses metaphor to reflect the purpose of the code  
3. **DO NOT invent file names** ‚Äî only reference those shown via "## File:" headers in the \`## Project Codebase\`
4. Reference 3‚Äì4 real technologies, tools, or patterns found in the code (e.g., server.ts, MCP handlers, tool registration)  
5. End with this line:  
   \`üó∫Ô∏è **Your Quest Awaits** ‚Äì Choose your path wisely, brave adventurer!\`

## üìú MANDATORY STORY FORMAT

Your story MUST include:

1. A themed title with line breaks before and after  
2. A narrative paragraph (75‚Äì100 words)  
3. The quest invitation line  

**CRITICAL: The "story" field in your JSON response MUST be formatted exactly like this:**

**üöÄ [Your Themed Title Here]**

Your narrative paragraph about the mission, journey, or adventure goes here. Make it 75-100 words that explains what this codebase does through your chosen theme.

üó∫Ô∏è **Your Quest Awaits** ‚Äì Choose your path wisely, brave adventurer!

**EXCELLENT EXAMPLE - USE AS STRUCTURAL TEMPLATE ONLY:**

**üöÄ Mission MCP: Refactor-1 and the Codebase Constellation**

Aboard the *Starship Refactor-1*, an elite crew of codonauts embarks on an interstellar mission to decode and optimize the galactic repository known as MCP. Guided by the cutting-edge *Repomix Navigator* and powered by *TypeScript Reactors*, the crew must traverse cosmic data streams, align architectural constellations, and unveil the mysteries of adventure-driven exploration. Their ultimate goal: to transform the sprawling complexity of the MCP system into a harmonious and navigable stellar map. The fate of the intergalactic coding alliance rests on their success.

üó∫Ô∏è **Your Quest Awaits** ‚Äì Choose your path wisely, brave adventurer!

‚ö†Ô∏è **CRITICAL: This is ONLY a structural template showing excellent integration. DO NOT copy any phrases, words, or concepts. Create completely original content that follows the same integration approach but uses entirely different vocabulary, metaphors, and narrative elements. Notice how it weaves real technologies (MCP, Repomix, TypeScript) into creative metaphors (Starship Refactor-1, codonauts, TypeScript Reactors, cosmic data streams).**

**WHAT MAKES THIS EXCELLENT:**
1. **Creative Technology Integration**: "Repomix Navigator", "TypeScript Reactors", "cosmic data streams" (real tech as themed elements)
2. **Purpose Clarity**: "decode and optimize the galactic repository", "transform sprawling complexity into navigable stellar map" (explains what MCP does)
3. **Themed Vocabulary**: "codonauts", "interstellar mission", "architectural constellations", "intergalactic coding alliance"
4. **Named Vessel**: "*Starship Refactor-1*" (creative name suggesting code improvement)
5. **Mission Focus**: Clear goal that matches the actual codebase purpose with engaging call-to-action

## üß≠ QUEST WRITING GUIDANCE

- Use **second-person** writing that immerses the reader: "You venture into the depths of...", "You discover the secrets of...", "You explore the ancient chambers of..."  
- **Each quest should connect to the main story theme** while focusing on its own exploration area  
- **Avoid standalone tasks** ‚Äî every quest should feel like part of the larger adventure world  
- Include **only relevant, existing file names**  
- **Make each quest compelling on its own** while contributing to the overall narrative

- Key algorithm implementations
- Files with important routing, protocol, or handler logic

**‚ùå Avoid:**

- Utility/helper files

## üì¶ INPUT SECTIONS

These are provided dynamically in each run of the prompt:

### Project Codebase - This is the full codebase listing the files with summaries
{{repomixContent}}

## Adventure Guidance Based Upon Project
{{adventureGuidance}}

## Theme Guidelines
{{themeGuidelines}}

---

## ‚úÖ FINAL INSTRUCTION

Create a single overarching story based on the \`## Project Codebase\`, and interconnected quests (dynamically sized based on project complexity) that explore different aspects of that story through real technical files. **Each quest should contribute to the main narrative while being explorable independently** ‚Äî users can choose their own adventure path. Each quest should feel like exploring a different area of the same thematic world, connected by the overall story but self-contained enough to be meaningful on its own.
