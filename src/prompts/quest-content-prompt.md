## Complete Codebase
{{codeContent}}{{adventureGuidance}}

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Code Authenticity Requirements - ZERO TOLERANCE FOR FAKE CODE
- **NEVER INVENT FUNCTIONS**: Use ONLY code that exists in the "## Complete Codebase" section above
- **NEVER CREATE EXAMPLES**: DO NOT create, modify, or invent any code examples whatsoever
- **VERIFY BEFORE INCLUDING**: Every function, variable, and code snippet MUST exist in the actual files
- **If no relevant code exists**: Say "No specific code functions were found for this file"
- **Show ONLY actual**: imports, function names, class names, and technologies from the files
- **FORBIDDEN**: Creating example functions like `calculateTrajectory()`, `processData()`, or any invented code

## Real-World Analogy Guidelines
For code snippet explanations, use relatable analogies:
- Functions → Restaurant recipes, factory assembly lines, or instruction manuals
- Classes → Blueprints, templates, or cookie cutters
- APIs → Restaurant menus, hotel front desks, or customer service counters
- Event handlers → Doorbell systems, alarm clocks, or notification services
- Data structures → Filing cabinets, toolboxes, or organizational systems
- Always connect the analogy back to the specific code being shown

## Professional Visual Enhancement Guidelines
Add tasteful visual elements to enhance readability and engagement:
- Use thematic emoticons as section headers: ⚡ 🔗 🛡️ 📊 🎯 ⭐
- Include simple ASCII borders for important sections: ─ Section ─ or ─ Title ─
- Add progress indicators where relevant: [██████░░░░] 
- Use clean separators: ─────────────────
- Keep visual elements minimal and professional - enhance, don't overwhelm

## Response Format (JSON)
{
  "adventure": "1 paragraph (75-100 words) continuing the themed narrative story only - keep brief",
  "fileExploration": "2-3 paragraphs (200-300 words) providing thorough walkthrough with professional visual elements - use ASCII borders, thematic emoticons as headers (⚡🔗🛡️📊), and clean formatting for better readability",
  "codeSnippets": [
    {
      "file": "filename",
      "snippet": "EXACT code from the files - ZERO INVENTED CODE - Use 'No code found' if none exists",
      "explanation": "Start with a real-world analogy, then explain ONLY the actual code shown - NEVER explain fake/invented code"
    }
  ],
  "hints": ["Practical tip", "Next steps"]
}

## ⚠️ FINAL VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
Before submitting your response, verify:
✅ Every code snippet exists in the "## Complete Codebase" section
✅ Every function name mentioned exists in the actual files  
✅ No invented/example code was created
✅ If no relevant code exists, you used "No code found" or similar
❌ NEVER submit responses with fake functions like `calculateTrajectory()`, `processData()`, etc.
