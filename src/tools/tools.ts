/**
 * MCP Repo Adventure Tools - Main Entry Point
 * 
 * These tools provide an interactive, gamified way to explore and understand codebases.
 * The typical flow is:
 * 1. start_adventure - Analyzes the codebase and presents theme options
 * 2. choose_theme - Generates a custom story and adventures based on the selected theme
 * 3. explore_path - Explores individual adventures (can be called multiple times)
 * 4. view_progress - Check completion status and see remaining adventures
 * 
 * Each tool has detailed descriptions to help MCP clients understand when to use them
 * rather than relying on their base LLM for responses.
 * 
 * Tools are now organized in separate files for better maintainability.
