# Galactic Adventures: The Code Chronicles

The Stellar Exploration Vessel *Codex Eternum* has embarked on its mission to chart the farthest reaches of the coding galaxy, unlocking the secrets of the universe through precise analysis, system optimization, and theme-based story generation. Powered by advanced LLM systems, your ship's success hinges on managing its core subsystems: mission tools, storytelling propulsion, data analyzers, configuration protocols, and foundational utilities. The fate of this celestial odyssey lies in your ability to master the code and maintain harmony in its stellar operations.

**Adventure Awaits** ‚Äì Choose your quest wisely, brave adventurer!

**üó∫Ô∏è Available Quests:**

**Quest 1: MCP Tool Interface** - You explore the bridge of *Codex Eternum*, operating mission control interfaces crafted in `packages/mcp/src/server.ts` and modular tools from `packages/mcp/src/tools.ts`.
**Quest 2: Quest Generation Engine** - You chart the ship's narrative propulsion system, diving into the power of `packages/core/src/adventure/adventure-manager.ts`, `packages/core/src/adventure/story-generator.ts`, and components of `packages/core/src/shared/adventure-config.ts`.
**Quest 3: Code Analysis & Content Pipeline** - You calibrate the code analyzers within the data bay, synchronizing `packages/core/src/analyzer/repo-analyzer.ts` with the stellar computations of `packages/core/src/llm/llm-client.ts`.
**Quest 4: Configuration & Theme System** - You configure the galaxy-wide adventure network by programming `packages/core/src/shared/config.ts` and harmonizing the themes from `packages/core/src/shared/theme.ts` and `packages/core/src/shared/input-validator.ts`.
**Quest 5: Foundation & Utilities** - You optimize the ship's foundational utilities to read star charts by enhancing the core pipeline in `packages/core/src/shared/adventure-config.ts`.
