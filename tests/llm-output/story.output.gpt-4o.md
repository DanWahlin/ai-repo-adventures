# Repository Adventure - Technical Documentation

This codebase is designed for creating interactive project analysis and adventure generation tools. It integrates a core logic module for analyzing git repositories and formats story-driven content using AI-assisted LLMs. The system is built with modular components to facilitate theme-based story creation and functionality for organizing and exploring repository analysis results. It employs tools like OpenAI/LLMs, Zod, and configuration management for robust extensibility across various adventure scenarios.
