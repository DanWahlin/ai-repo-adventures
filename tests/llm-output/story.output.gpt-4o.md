# 🚀 Mission Helios: Charting the Cosmic Codebase

In the vast reaches of the Helios System—a sprawling galaxy of untamed repositories—lies a beacon of hope: the Starship Omniflux. Tasked with taming the chaos of scattered codebases, the Omniflux charts the infinite void, turning wild constellations of files into harmonized stellar systems. Powered by the advanced Model Context Protocol (MCP) Core and guided by the adaptive Repomix Navigator, the crew must analyze, decode, and organize scattered data streams into coherent interstellar routes. The ultimate goal is to transform the Helios System into the definitive roadmap for future galactic explorers.
