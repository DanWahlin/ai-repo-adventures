# The Kingdom of Enchanted Code

The Book of Adventures, a legendary artifact responsible for weaving the realm's harmonious flow of quests and magic, has been corrupted by fragmented spells and wayward inputs. To restore order, you, a brave adventurer, must journey through the kingdom, exploring ancient scrolls and deciphering coded languages to revive the kingdom's lost equilibrium. At each stage of your journey, the fate of Codethra rests in your hands.
