# Quest 1: MCP Tool Interface
---
In the cosmic dance of bits and bytes, you find yourself navigating the Galactic Codebase, your mind filled with the mysteries of the `MCP` interface. With your starship's navigational tools, you seek to strengthen the interactive experience for fellow travelers. Through teamwork and sophisticated technology, you will reveal the treasure of knowledge hidden in the multilayered code. Each discovery will not only enhance your skills but also better prepare you for the next astral adventure amidst the stars.

## File Exploration
### packages/mcp/src/server.ts: The Command Bridge
This file acts as the command bridge of the starship, housing the `RepoAdventureServer` class. First, the `setupHandlers` method initializes dynamic request handling capabilities. This means as your ship encounters various tools, it can adapt seamlessly. The method `run` starts the server using `StdioServerTransport`, establishing communication channels with your crew. Finally, the `main` function outlines the liftoff sequence for the server, ensuring an orderly command structure for your exploration.

#### Highlights
- Initialization of request handlers for dynamic tool interactions.
- Execution of the main server run method for mission activation.
- Handling graceful shutdown to maintain system integrity.

## Code
### packages/mcp/src/server.ts
```typescript
private setupHandlers() {
    // Dynamic tool listing
    this.server.setRequestHandler(ListToolsRequestSchema, async () => {
```
This section dynamically sets up handlers upon server initialization, allowing your ship to identify and list available tools.

```typescript
async run() {
    const transport = new StdioServerTransport();
    await this.server.connect(transport);
```
The `run` method ensures that the server is operational, establishing transport channels for interstellar communication with your crew.

```typescript
async function main() {
    try {
        const server = new RepoAdventureServer();
```
The `main` function serves as the launch sequence, coordinating the initialization of your adventure server while handling potential errors during the process.

## Helpful Hints
- Use the command `view_progress` to track your journey through the code cosmos.
- Explore different themes with `choose_theme` to uncover unique quests.
- Keep an eye on your system logs for unexpected errors that may impact your quest.
