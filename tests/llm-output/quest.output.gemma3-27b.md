# Quest 1: Bridge Navigation System

---
Our ship, the *Explorer*, has encountered a critical system failure in the bridge navigation array. Initial diagnostics reveal corrupted data streams impacting the accuracy of our stellar charts and trajectory calculations. Your mission is to analyze the data processing pipeline, identify the source of the corruption, and implement a solution to restore accurate navigation. This is a high-priority task, as any further delay could jeopardize our mission to chart the uncharted territories beyond.

## Quest Objectives
- üîç **Data Stream Analysis**: Examine the `RepoAdventureServer.setupHandlers` function. What types of request handlers are being registered and what data formats do they expect?
- ‚ö° **Pipeline Flow**: Trace the execution flow of the `RepoAdventureServer.run` function. What is the sequence of operations performed on incoming requests?
- üõ°Ô∏è **Error Handling**: Inspect the error handling mechanisms within `RepoAdventureServer.run`. How does the server respond to invalid requests or unexpected errors during data processing?

## File Exploration
### packages/mcp/src/server.ts
This file serves as the core entry point and orchestration layer for the MCP (Model Context Protocol) server. It is responsible for setting up request handlers, managing incoming requests, and coordinating communication between different modules. The `setupHandlers` function defines the available API endpoints and their corresponding handlers, while the `run` function handles the incoming requests, validates input, processes data, and returns responses. Error handling is crucial within `run` to maintain system stability and provide informative responses to clients.

#### Highlights
- `RepoAdventureServer.setupHandlers`: This function registers request handlers for various API endpoints, such as choosing a theme, exploring a quest, and viewing progress. It establishes the interface between the client and the server, defining the available services.
- `RepoAdventureServer.run`: This function acts as the central dispatcher for handling incoming client requests. It validates the request, determines the appropriate handler based on the request path, and executes the handler, returning the result to the client.
- `RepoAdventureServer.constructor`: This initialization process sets up event listeners, logging capabilities, and other essential components of the server. It is crucial for ensuring system stability and providing real-time monitoring.

```typescript
// packages/mcp/src/server.ts
import express, { Request, Response } from 'express';
import cors from 'cors';
import { chooseTheme, exploreQuest, viewProgress } from './tools';

export class RepoAdventureServer {
  private app: express.Application;
  private port: number;

  constructor(port: number = 3000) {
    this.app = express();
    this.port = port;
    this.setupMiddleware();
    this.setupHandlers();
  }

  private setupMiddleware(): void {
    this.app.use(cors());
    this.app.use(express.json());
  }

  public setupHandlers(): void {
    this.app.post('/choose_theme', chooseTheme);
    this.post('/explore_quest', exploreQuest);
    this.post('/view_progress', viewProgress);
  }

  public run(): void {
    this.app.listen(this.port, () => {
      console.log(`Server listening on port ${this.port}`);
    });
  }
}
```

- The `setupHandlers` function defines the API endpoints for the adventure server. Each endpoint corresponds to a specific action, enabling the frontend to interact with the backend.
- The `run` function starts the Express.js server and listens for incoming requests on the specified port. It‚Äôs the entry point for the server's operation.
- Error handling is currently minimal, relying on Express.js default error handling. In a production environment, more robust error logging and handling mechanisms would be essential.

```typescript
// packages/mcp/src/server.ts
import express, { Request, Response } from 'express';
import cors from 'cors';
import { chooseTheme, exploreQuest, viewProgress } from './tools';

export class RepoAdventureServer {
  private app: express.Application;
  private port: number;

  constructor(port: number = 3000) {
    this.app = express();
    this.port = port;
    this.setupMiddleware();
    this.setupHandlers();
  }

  private setupMiddleware(): void {
    this.app.use(cors());
    this.app.use(express.json());
  }

  public setupHandlers(): void {
    this.app.post('/choose_theme', chooseTheme);
    this.app.post('/explore_quest', exploreQuest);
    this.app.post('/view_progress', viewProgress);
  }

  public run(): void {
    this.app.listen(this.port, () => {
      console.log(`Server listening on port ${this.port}`);
    });
  }
}
```

- This section defines the core structure of the server. The constructor initializes the Express application and sets up the middleware.
- `setupHandlers` registers the API endpoints using `app.post`, mapping each endpoint to its corresponding handler function. This establishes the communication channels for the client.
- The `run` function starts the server and listens for incoming requests, allowing the application to respond to client interactions.

---

## Helpful Hints
- Pay close attention to the request-response cycle within the `run` function. Understanding how requests are processed and responses are generated is crucial for debugging data corruption issues.
- Explore the `tools.ts` file to understand the implementation details of the handler functions.
- Consider adding logging statements to the server to track request parameters, intermediate data values, and error messages.
