# Quest 5: The Altar of Interaction
---
In the heart of the ancient jungle, amidst the undisturbed ruins of a sophisticated past, you discover the "Altar of Interaction"—a construct used to harmonize systems within this lost civilization. By studying the intricate code paths and interacting with the structures of their technologies, you can uncover how their interconnected frameworks operated with precision. This altar's glyphs speak of systems that once synchronized the civilization’s greatest tools, ensuring seamless exchanges of power and wisdom. Decode the messages hidden within and restore their essence to the present.

## Quest Objectives
As you explore the code below, investigate these key questions:
- 🔍 **Thematic Weaves**: How are themes defined and categorized to maintain their sacred significance across the system?
- ⚡ **Validation Mechanisms**: What techniques are used to safeguard user inputs and ensure harmony with the system requirements?
- 🛡️ **Resurrection of Settings**: How does the system preserve and apply key configuration details to optimize interactions?

## File Exploration
### packages/core/src/shared/config.ts: Configuration Settings
This file establishes the foundational settings for the interaction systems, defining how resources like timeouts and limits are managed across the platform. The constants here are like the sacred equations that govern the altar’s rituals, structuring parameters for harmonious operations. It provides essential configurations for API interactions, error messaging, and key limits like maximum file sizes and processing times.

#### Highlights
- `LLM_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` controls the allowable duration for data exchanges, ensuring that distant "rituals" complete without undue delays.
- `REPOMIX_CACHE_TTL` manages caching lifespans, reflecting the civilization’s efficient reuse of memory.
- `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB` upholds the altar’s sacred rule of analyzing only manageably sized files.

## Code
### packages/core/src/shared/config.ts
```typescript
export const LLM_REQUEST_TIMEOUT = parseInt(process.env.LLM_REQUEST_TIMEOUT || '60000'); // 60 seconds for complex story generation with large prompts, configurable via env
export const REPOMIX_CACHE_TTL = parseInt(process.env.REPOMIX_CACHE_TTL || '60000'); // 60 seconds, configurable via env
export const MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB = 10; // Skip files larger than this to avoid memory issues and focus on source code
```
- These constants define essential operational limits for the system, reflecting optimized thresholds for performance.
- `LLM_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` allows flexibility by enabling configuration via environment variables (env).
- `REPOMIX_CACHE_TTL` illustrates the efficient reuse of resources by limiting cache lifetimes.
- The `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB` rule prioritizes focus, avoiding hazardous file sizes.

### packages/core/src/shared/theme.ts: Theme Definitions
This module serves as the definitive guide to the themes of the system, akin to the architectural blueprints of the altar. It describes each "theme" with attributes like name, symbol, description, and its alignment with potential user inputs. These definitions form the heart of maintaining the altar’s symbolic power and aesthetic harmony.

#### Highlights
- `THEMES` enumerates the core identities of each theme and their unique attributes, preserving the integrity of cultural designs.
- `getAllThemes` simplifies accessing all thematic definitions for system-wide consistency.
- `parseTheme` employs string-matching techniques to interpret user-provided inputs, mapping them to valid themes.

## Code
### packages/core/src/shared/theme.ts
```typescript
export const THEMES = {
  SPACE: { ... },
  MYTHICAL: { ... },
  ANCIENT: {
    id: 3,
    key: 'ancient',
    displayName: 'Ancient Civilization',
    emoji: '🏺',
    description: 'Discover lost temples of code where algorithms are ancient wisdom and APIs are trade routes',
    keywords: ['ancient', 'temple', 'pyramid', 'archaeology', 'historical', 'civilization', 'ruins']
  },
  DEVELOPER: { ... },
  CUSTOM: { ... }
} as const;
```
- `THEMES` defines the symbolic and functional identity of each theme, capturing its essence with clear attributes.
- Specifically, the "ANCIENT" theme matches the overarching narrative with its archaeological descriptors.
- Using `as const` ensures these values remain immutable, mirroring the sacred permanence of the altar's inscriptions.

---

```typescript
export function getAllThemes(): ThemeDefinition[] {
  return THEMES_ARRAY;
}
```
- `getAllThemes` centralizes access to all thematic options, maintaining a consistent source of truth across the system.
- This simple function highlights efficient data design by leveraging the existing `THEMES_ARRAY`.

---

```typescript
export function parseTheme(input: string): AdventureTheme | null {
  if (!input) return null;
  
  const normalized = input.trim().toLowerCase();
  
  const exactMatch = getThemeByKey(normalized);
  if (exactMatch) return exactMatch.key as AdventureTheme;
  
  const numericId = parseInt(normalized, 10);
  if (!isNaN(numericId)) {
    const byId = getThemeById(numericId);
    if (byId) return byId.key as AdventureTheme;
  }
  
  for (const theme of THEMES_ARRAY) {
    if (theme.keywords.some(keyword => normalized.includes(keyword.toLowerCase()))) {
      return theme.key as AdventureTheme;
    }
  }
  
  return null;
}
```
- `parseTheme` employs multiple strategies to interpret input, showcasing flexibility and robustness.
- It performs direct matches, numeric ID checks, and keyword inclusions to ensure accuracy in identifying themes.
- This method reinforces a user-friendly interplay with the altar, permitting varied input styles.

### packages/core/src/shared/input-validator.ts: Validation Rites
As the guardians of the altar's integrity, these validation functions ensure all interactions align with the civilization’s established rules. This file harmonizes the inputs to maintain the sanctity of the system, guarding against corruption and invalid operations.

#### Highlights
- `validateAdventureChoice` ensures ritualistic inputs adhere to structural constraints.
- `validateTheme` confirms that themes are valid offerings, reflecting the sacred allowances of the altar.
- `sanitizeForDisplay` protects visual representations from disruptive anomalies.

## Code
### packages/core/src/shared/input-validator.ts
```typescript
export function validateAdventureChoice(input: string): string {
  if (!input?.trim()) {
    throw new Error('Choice is required');
  }
  
  if (input.length > 200) {
    throw new Error('Choice too long (max 200 characters)');
  }
  
  return input.trim();
}
```
- This function checks for the presence of input, trims whitespace, and enforces a character limit to keep choices concise.
- It represents a simple yet impactful layer against disruptive inputs, upholding clarity and focus.

---

```typescript
export function validateTheme(input: string): string {
  if (!input?.trim()) {
    throw new Error('Theme is required');
  }
  
  const normalized = input.toLowerCase().trim();
  const parsedTheme = parseTheme(normalized);
  
  if (!parsedTheme || !isValidTheme(parsedTheme)) {
    const validThemes = getAllThemes().map(t => t.key).join(', ');
    throw new Error(`Invalid theme. Valid themes: ${validThemes}`);
  }
  
  return parsedTheme;
}
```
- This function validates user-provided themes by normalizing inputs and ensuring validity through predefined sacred lists.
- Dynamic error handling offers both precision and user guidance.

---

```typescript
export function sanitizeForDisplay(input: string, maxLength = 1000): string {
  if (!input) return '';
  
  return input
    .replace(/[<>{}"`]/g, '')
    .replace(/\s+/g, ' ')
    .trim()
    .slice(0, maxLength);
}
```
- `sanitizeForDisplay` protects visual outputs from harmful content by stripping dangerous characters and trimming excess.
- By inline cleaning, it supports the altar’s display mechanisms in maintaining purity and elegance.

---

## Helpful Hints
- Pay attention to how immutability in `THEMES` enhances reliability.
- Consider the layered input validations and how they mitigate risks.
- Examine how the `parseTheme` function balances user flexibility with stability.
