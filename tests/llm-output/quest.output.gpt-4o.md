# Quest 5: Configuration & Theme System
---
Aboard the starship *Celestial Refactor*, the crew approaches a critical juncture in the journey through the interstellar codebase. The task at hand? To unravel the complex mechanisms governing configuration and theme systems, ensuring seamless adaptability for cosmic explorers navigating infinite possibilities. Your team faces a constellation of structured variables, validation functions, and dynamic theme generators. This final quest is the keystone of the mission, tying functionality to aesthetic purpose, ensuring harmonious operation as you chart the stars of innovation.

## Quest Objectives
As you explore the code below, investigate these crucial questions:
- 🔍 **Stellar Timeout Calibration**: How is timeout handled for system operations, and what patterns ensure adaptability in cosmic-scale operations?
- ⚡ **Thematic Mapping Frequencies**: How are theme definitions structured, and what safeguards make them reusable across various space-modules?
- 🛡️ **Orbital Validation Shields**: How does input validation protect against edge cases and cosmic anomalies?

## File Exploration
### packages/core/src/shared/config.ts: System Configuration Nexus
This file is the nerve center of the starship’s configuration system, where constants and environment variables dictate operations. It controls timeout thresholds, cache limits, and error messages for consistency across galactic missions. Scalable constraints ensure the mission adapts to varying data conditions. 

#### Highlights
- `LLM_REQUEST_TIMEOUT`: Defines the API request timeout duration for Large Language Model operations, ensuring responsiveness while avoiding infinite stalls.
- `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB`: Regulates the maximum allowable file size, upholding stability in interstellar data analysis workflows.
- `ERROR_MESSAGES`: Provides centralized, consistent error messaging, creating a safety net during unexpected anomalies.

### packages/core/src/shared/theme.ts: Cosmic Theme Repository
This file hosts the logic for managing themes, bringing your starship's journey to life. It defines the thematic structure and contains helper functions to map user inputs to defined themes. The elegance of the theme system lies in its adaptability for various mission contexts.

#### Highlights
- `THEMES`: Central repository for theme definitions, interlinking descriptions, emojis, and keywords to streamline identification and display.
- `parseTheme`: Parses user input to match valid themes, ensuring linguistic flexibility and efficient keyword recognition.
- `getAllThemes`: Retrieves the complete list of themes, serving as a single source of truth for interactive interfaces.

### packages/generator/src/cli/theme-manager.ts: Dynamic Theme Operations
This file operates the dynamic engine for organizing and rendering themes. It ensures consistent presentation by combining CSS files for layouts and adapting assets based on a theme's properties. It safeguards against incorrect theme usage during the rendering process.

#### Highlights
- `generateThemeCSS`: Dynamically compiles CSS files for a given theme to ensure seamless integration of aesthetics across all mission components.
- `getGitHubLogo`: Fetches the appropriate GitHub logo based on whether a theme uses a light or dark background, balancing visuals and readability.
- `getThemeIcons`: Maps each theme to unique icons, enhancing immersive user experiences for quest navigation.

## Code
### packages/core/src/shared/config.ts
```typescript
export const LLM_REQUEST_TIMEOUT = parseInt(process.env.LLM_REQUEST_TIMEOUT || '60000'); // 60 seconds for complex story generation
export const MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB = 10; // Skip files larger than this to focus on meaningful source code
export const ERROR_MESSAGES = {
  LLM_UNAVAILABLE: 'LLM service is currently unavailable. Please check your configuration.',
  ANALYSIS_FAILED: 'Failed to analyze the project. Please ensure the path is valid.',
  THEME_INVALID: 'Invalid theme specified. Using default theme.',
  FILE_NOT_FOUND: 'The requested file could not be found.',
  PERMISSION_DENIED: 'Permission denied accessing the specified path.',
} as const;
```
- `LLM_REQUEST_TIMEOUT` ensures system responsiveness and optimizes request strategies for complex computational tasks.
- `MAX_FILE_SIZE_MB` limits file size to maintain memory stability and focus analysis on relevant data.
- `ERROR_MESSAGES` centralizes error handling to improve consistency and instantly communicate failures.

### packages/core/src/shared/theme.ts
```typescript
export const THEMES = {
  SPACE: {
    id: 1,
    key: 'space',
    displayName: 'Space Exploration',
    emoji: '🚀',
    description: 'Journey through cosmic codebases where data flows like stardust and APIs connect distant galaxies',
    keywords: ['space', 'cosmic', 'galaxy', 'starship', 'astronaut', 'sci-fi', 'futuristic']
  },
  MYTHICAL: {
    id: 2,
    key: 'mythical',
    displayName: 'Enchanted Kingdom',
    emoji: '🏰',
    description: 'Explore magical and mythical realms where databases are dragon hoards and functions are powerful spells',
    keywords: ['mythical', 'magic', 'enchanted', 'castle', 'dragon', 'fantasy', 'medieval', 'kingdom']
  }
} as const;

export function parseTheme(input: string): AdventureTheme | null {
  if (!input) return null;
  
  const normalized = input.trim().toLowerCase();
  const exactMatch = getThemeByKey(normalized);
  if (exactMatch) return exactMatch.key as AdventureTheme;
  
  const numericId = parseInt(normalized, 10);
  if (!isNaN(numericId)) {
    const byId = getThemeById(numericId);
    if (byId) return byId.key as AdventureTheme;
  }
  
  return THEMES_ARRAY.find(theme => theme.keywords.some(keyword => normalized.includes(keyword.toLowerCase()))).key as AdventureTheme ?? null;
}

export function getAllThemes(): ThemeDefinition[] {
  return Object.values(THEMES);
}
```
- `THEMES` creates a vivid, reusable theme framework with encapsulated metadata.
- `parseTheme` translates user input into valid themes by matching strings or recognizing IDs.
- `getAllThemes` offers an accessible library of themes for intuitive program integration.

### packages/generator/src/cli/theme-manager.ts
```typescript
generateThemeCSS(theme: AdventureTheme, outputDir: string): void {
  const cssFiles = [
    path.join(this.themesDir, 'base.css'),
    path.join(this.themesDir, 'homepage.css'), 
    path.join(this.themesDir, 'animations.css'),
    path.join(this.themesDir, `${theme}.css`)
  ];
  
  let combinedCSS = '';
  cssFiles.forEach(cssFile => {
    if (fs.existsSync(cssFile)) {
      combinedCSS += fs.readFileSync(cssFile, 'utf8') + '\\n\\n';
    }
  });
  const cssPath = path.join(outputDir, 'assets', 'theme.css');
  fs.writeFileSync(cssPath, combinedCSS);
}

getGitHubLogo(theme: AdventureTheme): string {
  return this.isLightTheme(theme) ? 'assets/shared/github-mark.svg' : 'assets/shared/github-mark-white.svg';
}

getThemeIcons(theme: AdventureTheme): { theme: string; quest: string } {
  const themeIcons = {
    space: { theme: '🚀', quest: '⭐' },
    mythical: { theme: '🏰', quest: '⚔️' },
    ancient: { theme: '🏺', quest: '📜' },
    developer: { theme: '💻', quest: '🔧' },
    custom: { theme: '🎨', quest: '⭐' }
  };

  return (themeIcons as any)[theme] || themeIcons.space;
}
```
- `generateThemeCSS` merges essential CSS files to ensure harmonious application across varied themes.
- `getGitHubLogo` dynamically selects suitable logos for themes, enhancing visual design alignment.
