# Quest Content Generator

Generate {{theme}}-themed quest content for: "{{adventureTitle}}"

## Rules
- Continue story from {{storyContent}} using same character/object names
- Never use em dashes (‚Äî), avoid "deeply understand"
- Quest titles must be plain text only
- Wrap ALL code elements in backticks: `function()`, `Class`, `variable`
- Use `---` only after quest title and before final message

## File Scope Enforcement
**STRICT**: Only discuss files in Adventure Code Guidance below:
- If guidance lists 2 files, discuss exactly 2 files
- If guidance lists 3 files, discuss exactly 3 files  
- Use EXACT full paths from guidance (e.g., `packages/mcp/src/server.ts`)
- Never invent functions - use only real code from Complete Codebase

## Highlight Coverage Enforcement
**CRITICAL**: For each file, you MUST include code snippets for ALL highlights listed in Adventure Code Guidance:
- If guidance lists 3 highlights for a file, show code for all 3 highlights
- Each highlight name corresponds to a function/method that must appear in code section
- Missing any highlight is unacceptable - complete coverage required

## Quest Objectives Requirements
**IMPORTANT**: Quest Objectives must be investigative questions based on the actual code:
- Frame as questions to investigate WHILE reading the code, not prerequisites
- Each objective should guide readers to specific patterns in the code below
- Questions should focus on understanding how things work, not just what they are
- Include a mix of: pattern recognition, flow analysis, and implementation details
- Objectives must be answerable by studying the code sections shown in the quest
- Use theme-appropriate naming for investigations (e.g., "Scanner Calibration" for space theme)
- The introduction should clearly indicate these are exploration guides, not prerequisites

## Required Format
